# Restaurants_and_House_Prices

##Presentation:

###Topic: Diversity of restaurants and how they related to median house prices by zip code
###Reason: We selected this dataset because we believe that more affluent neighborhoods tend to have a more diverse set of dining options, and we would like to confirm or deny our thoughts.
###Description of our source data:
- Yelp Data Set
- Zillow Data Set
###Questions:
- Can yelp reviews help us determine housing prices? 
- Can we predict diversity (type of restaurant) of restaurants based on housing prices?
