# Restaurants_and_House_Prices

## Presentation:

### Topic: 
Diversity of restaurants and how they related to median house prices by zip code
### Reason: 
We selected this dataset because we believe that more affluent neighborhoods tend to have a more diverse set of dining options, and we would like to confirm or deny our thoughts.
