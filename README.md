# Restaurants_and_House_Prices

## Presentation:

### Topic: Diversity of restaurants and how they related to median house prices by zip code
### Reason: We selected this dataset because we believe that more affluent neighborhoods tend to have a more diverse set of dining options, and we would like to confirm or deny our thoughts.
### Description of our source data:
- Yelp Data Set
-   Source: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download
-   Documentation: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main
-   Includes 5 JSONs: businesses, checkins, reviews, tips, users
-   Summary of Businesses Dataset (most likely what we’ll be using):
-     Covers “11 Metropolitan Areas” but is missing some notable major cities such as New York City.
-     Of the top 20 cities in the US (according  to 2020 US Census), the dataset includes: Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Austin, Charlotte, Columbus, Indianapolis,  Denver, Washington DC.
-     Total of 1273 unique cities
-     Total 3362 unique zip codes

- Zillow Data Set
### Questions:
- Can yelp reviews help us determine housing prices? 
- Can we predict diversity (type of restaurant) of restaurants based on housing prices?
